## Why I Lift

I one day randomly stumbled upon fitness YouTube and binge watched the entire Will Tennyson Channel. That motivated me to start doing some calisthenics and after a little over a year or so of that I started going to the gym.

My original plan was to become the strongest femboy in the whole wide world but now I just do it because it's fun.

## My Training Philosophy

### Science-Based

For most of my lifting journey I wasn't a fan of science based stuff but those lil charts really are cool so I guess I kinda do that idk.

### Harder Than Last Time

As a Greg Doucette Fan I obviously have to train harder than last time, even though silly people keep telling me that that's not even possible BUT IT IS!!!! IT IS PERSONAL!!!! (Salamonki reference) grrrrr.

### Balance

Also it's very important not to be too obsessed with training because there's only so much you can do. So I just do my daily workout and ideally don't think about the gym for the rest of the day.
