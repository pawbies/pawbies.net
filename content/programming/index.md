## My Programming Journey

Honestly I forgot why I even started and looking bad I probably should've been more interested in farming. Being a farmer sounds like a better life than being a programmer.

## Languages & Technologies

### Primary Languages

**Ruby** - My favorite language, super use to work with when building CLI applications and Ruby on Rails is the best web framework out there.

**JavaScript** - I don't like it but web development forces you to use it to some degree. Frameworks like Stimulus make it okay to work with.

### Technologies I Work With

- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind, JavaScript, Hotwire
- **Backend**: Ruby on Rails
- **Databases**: Postgres
- **DevOps**: Docker
- **Cloud**: fly.io, Cloudflare

## Current Projects

I'm always working on something new. Right now I'm focused on:

- **schinkenfuchs.com**: Project by a friend and me
- **pawbies.net**: My own website
- Learning new things

## My Development Philosophy

### Write good code

Fr it's so much better to struggle for hours to write some good code than to write sloppy code that works but isn't maintainable.

### Continuous Learning

People that refuse to learn and use new technologies are so annoying, of course it depends on the field in which you're working but how are you clinging onto your existing tech stack in web development!?

### Micro-optimize

Some might argue that it's a bad practice but honestly trying to build the most perfect solution possible - even if it takes really long - is fun. If it's not maximally optimised it's not good enough.

## Favorite Tools

- **Code Editor**: Neovim
- **Terminal**: Kitty
- **Shell**: Fish
- **Notes**: Emacs Org Mode

## What I'm Learning Next

- **React Native** for mobile app development
- **Java** as a baseline for **Kotlin** and **Spring Boot**

## Stuff I once know but have forgotten

- **C & C++** - I guess I know the basics but I like to think that I was once really good in C++
- **Rust** - Was never good at it, still don't like it, Rust people are weird, super weird.
Honestly I'm pretty sure the Rust is used by the same people as JavaScript. They try to use their language for every problem out there. It's fine for low level applications and CLI applications but what the hell is up which those people that use it for their website frontend?
- **Python** - That was the first programming language I ever learned. Solid 8/10 but Ruby is better.
- **Low level stuff in general**
