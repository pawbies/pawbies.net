## Hey there! 👋

Haiiiiii! Welcome to my website. This is a lil page about myself.

## What I Do

I'm a silly little femboy-programmer-lifter or something like that :3. One day I want to become a cute dogboy but technology isn't quite there yet.

## My Hobbies


**💻 Programming** - That's my creative thingy I guess. I like exploring different technologies and stuffs and building projects. [More about programming](/programming)

**💪 Bodybuilding** - Apparently I also need to do physical activities to stay healthy so I regularly pick up heavy weights and put them back down. Sadly this not only makes me stronger but also gives me this unsightly muscle. Now I'm stuck between not being big enough and not being twinkish enough. [More about bodybuilding](/bodybuilding)

## Life Besides That

I also like to spend time with my super cute boyfriend, he also has a website so visit his too: [His Website](https://metzger.studio) ❤️
