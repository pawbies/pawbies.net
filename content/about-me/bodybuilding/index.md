## Why I Lift

Bodybuilding is where I learned discipline, patience, and the power of consistency. It's not just about building muscle—it's about building character. Every rep, every set, every workout is a commitment to becoming better than yesterday.

The gym is my second home, a place where I can push my limits and see tangible results from hard work.

## My Training Philosophy

### Consistency Over Intensity

The best workout is the one you actually do. I'd rather train consistently at 80% than burn out chasing 100% every session. Progressive overload happens over months and years, not days.

### Mind-Muscle Connection

I focus on feeling every rep, not just moving weight. Quality contractions and proper form trump ego-lifting every time.

### Balance and Recovery

Growth happens outside the gym. I prioritize sleep, nutrition, and recovery as much as my training sessions.

## Training Split

I follow a **Push/Pull/Legs** routine that I've refined over time:

### Push Day (Chest, Shoulders, Triceps)
- Bench Press variations
- Overhead Press
- Dips and cable work
- Isolation movements for detail

### Pull Day (Back, Biceps)
- Deadlift variations
- Pull-ups and rows
- Bicep curls and hammer curls
- Rear delt work

### Leg Day (Quads, Hamstrings, Calves)
- Squats (the king of exercises)
- Romanian Deadlifts
- Leg press and extensions
- Calf raises

I typically run this twice per week with active recovery days in between.

## Nutrition Approach

### Macros Matter

I track my protein, carbs, and fats to ensure I'm fueling my body properly. Protein is king for muscle growth—I aim for about 0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight.

### Flexible Dieting

I don't believe in "clean" vs "dirty" foods. I eat what fits my macros while prioritizing whole, nutrient-dense foods 80-90% of the time. Life's too short to never enjoy a good meal.

### Pre and Post Workout

- **Pre-workout**: Complex carbs and moderate protein for sustained energy
- **Post-workout**: Fast-digesting protein and carbs to kickstart recovery

### Supplements I Use

- Whey protein for convenience
- Creatine monohydrate (tried and true)
- Multivitamin for insurance
- Caffeine when needed

## Favorite Exercises

**Deadlifts** - The ultimate full-body builder. Nothing feels quite like a heavy deadlift.

**Weighted Pull-ups** - Best back builder in my opinion.

**Incline Dumbbell Press** - Perfect for upper chest development.

**Bulgarian Split Squats** - Brutal but effective for legs.

**Face Pulls** - Underrated for shoulder health and rear delts.

## The Mental Game

### Discipline Beats Motivation

Motivation comes and goes. Discipline is what gets me to the gym on days when I don't feel like it. That's when real progress happens.

### Progress Takes Time

Building muscle is a marathon, not a sprint. I measure progress in months and years, not days or weeks. Trust the process.

### Embrace the Grind

Some days the weights feel heavy. Some workouts are a struggle. That's normal. Show up anyway.

## Lessons from the Iron

Bodybuilding has taught me more than just how to build muscle:

- **Patience**: Results don't come overnight
- **Resilience**: Push through plateaus and setbacks
- **Self-discipline**: Show up even when you don't want to
- **Goal-setting**: Long-term vision with short-term milestones
- **Self-awareness**: Listen to your body

## Balancing Code and Iron

As a programmer, I spend a lot of time sitting. Bodybuilding is the perfect counterbalance—it keeps me healthy, energized, and mentally sharp. The discipline from training carries over into my coding practice.

Plus, some of my best problem-solving happens during rest periods between sets.
